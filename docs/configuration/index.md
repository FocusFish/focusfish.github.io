# Configuration

An out-of-the-box UVMS installation is configured to work in a test
environment. Each module has a corresponding tab under `Admin->Configuration`,
with the exception of exchange plugins which have their configuration under the
exchange tab. To configure `UVMS`:

1. Open `<HOST>:28080/unionvms/#/admin/configuration`.
1. Click on the tab corresponding to the module that is to be configured.
1. Click the `edit`-button (pen icon).
1. Change the value (inline in the table).
1. Click the `check mark`-button to save the changes.
